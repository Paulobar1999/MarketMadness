To install MarketMadness all you need is a compatible version of Java, (Java 8, jre1.8.0_221) or newer, and a version of JavaFX installed into your IDE of choice.

Next you must import the project, you can do so by manually downloading it and importing it as a compressed file, or if you have EGit installed you can import it directly from GitHub. 

**Playing** 

Once installed simply navigate to Main.java inside of src, there you can click "Run Main", you should be greeted by the main menu.
